Ideals are virtues.  They are the result of long held discrete actions.  

In no particular order, here are our who we strive to be:

- Be a mensch.  This means be helpful; be a positive force; your negative energy is checked and actively nullified; you're helpful to the point that maybe you're slowed down just a bit.
- Tell us the negative news first.  Like, before the news you are hearing is still mid-sentence.  We strive to avoid Persian Messenger Syndrome.  "Negative" news (information) is painful but should be viewed as positive for it is the basecamp to our ascent to truth (wisdom).
